    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Canai Bread</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (extra for dusting)</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Curry Dipping Sauce:</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoon curry paste (panang and massaman are my favorites)</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, minced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 can coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How to cook:</strong></p>
    <p>1. For the dough: Combine the flour and salt, and slowly incorporate the water a few tablespoons at a time, while mixing with your hands. Once a mass of dough is formed, begin kneading it on a flat surface for about 8-10 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle in a little flour, until the dough feel smooth. Roll the dough into a log and pinch off palm-sized dough balls.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2. Place them in a bowl and submerge them in vegetable oil. Let them rest for a few hours or overnight. This will relax the gluten and allow you to stretch it easily.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>3. While the dough is resting, make the curry dipping sauce. In a pot, heat the ghee and saute the shallot and garlic, until translucent. Stir in the curry paste and cook for about 2-3 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, stir until well combined, and season with salt to taste. Set aside and work on the roti.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>4. On a well oiled surface (you may use vegetable oil or ghee) press and stretch each dough ball until you form a wide, paper thin disks or rectangles. Fold each edge toward the middle and pan fry in a little ghee for a few minutes. They are ready to flip when golden brown and bubbly.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>5. Fluff each roti by quickly pressing the edges towards to middle, and serve with a small bowl of hot curry sauce.</p>
